Are we Really Teaching?


I am a student. An engineering student, to be precise. For the sake of this ultra-precision age, i am an computer engineering student 
currently studying 3rd semester of my 8-semester long college. 

This blog post is not only about teachers, but also relates to student-businees-makers (a.k.a 'Founders' of an college), and overall school/college trend.


Let me start with a relevant data, <em>more than</em> 60 percent of people could not pass the two semester that I've been through. (Luckily, I passed!).

And when it comes to teachers, and the so-called policy makers (a.k.a 'Founders'....) come to the class too often to tell us to read.

Okay, It's true that the engineering course (in nepal) is tough, and students don't <em>read</em>....

Wait <em><strong>read</strong></em>! 

First Question to the College management: Have you ever tried to assess why do not they read ?

Answer: Because they are lazy! They do not care about....and blah. 

I am an average student. I feel like i am the laziest person in my class. I literally haven't studied my courseware in my home except on my free time during loadshedding hours (which is about 6 hours a week, if maximum)

And I've seen friends who actually read! And whose academic level are way too much high than me!

And I've seen friend who don't read! The particular one which i am going to discuss!
