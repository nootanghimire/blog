Are we Really Teaching?


I am a student. An engineering student, to be precise. For the sake of this ultra-precision age, i am an computer engineering student 
currently studying 3rd semester of my 8-semester long college. 

This blog post is not only about teachers, but also relates to student-businees-makers (a.k.a 'Founders' of an college), and overall school/college trend.


Let me start with a relevant data, <em>more than</em> 60 percent of people could not pass the two semester that I've been through. (Luckily, I passed!).

And when it comes to teachers, and the so-called policy makers (a.k.a 'Founders'....) come to the class too often to tell us to read.

Okay, It's true that the engineering course (in nepal) is tough, and students don't <em>read</em>....

Wait <em><strong>read</strong></em>! 

First Question to the College management: Have you ever tried to assess why do not they read ?

Answer: Because they are lazy! They do not care about....and blah. 

I am an average student. I feel like i am the laziest person in my class. I literally haven't studied my courseware in my home except on my free time during loadshedding hours (which is about 6 hours a week, if maximum)

And I've seen friends who actually read! And whose academic level are way too much high than me!

And I've seen friend who don't read! The particular one which i am going to discuss!

I often talk with a lot of friends and I see a lot of similarities between those two types of friends. For instance, Both of the friends are equally aware of their career. Both of them has this "i-have-to-read" thought somewhere in their heart. 
And the thing why talented friends are talented is because they let this "i-have-to-read" thought overcome almost anything else. So, They are basically controlled by "i-have-to-read" thought.

<!--I just remember a conversation with my friend about his friend. 

He(My friends' friend) got temporarily restricted from college because he was drunk, he smoked weed, fight, and ... He was the person who used to get the highest marks in <em>any</em> examinations.

Here are his words, (not verbatim but re-structured) "I do a lot of things, good and bad, but i just read when i have to! It does not matter to me whether i am high, i just read!"

The point is: People read when their i-have-to-read thought overcomes almost anything!-->

The most common phrase you hear with not-so-talented people is: "I tried to read. But I cannot understand anything!" They also know why: "I didn't pay any attention in class. Pity on myself!"

Eventually it comes to classroom. And this phrase: <em><strong>I didn't pay any attention in class.</strong></em>.

I am positive that it's a major student-problem: Not paying attention in class. But isn't this a topic for discussion? Why? Why didn't I pay any attention in class?

The answer to me is simple, "Because I do not like the way s/he teaches!"

And yet, there are a lot of teachers where people actually pay attention to! Why? "Because I like the way s/he teaches!"

But, what is that <em>way</em>? How should a teacher teach?

The first thing that i feel is: Be close with students! This is one of the most important thing a teacher should do. How can a teacher be close with students? Well. Be student-friendly. No one is going to respect you because you planted a seed of fear to students. 

A lot of teacher (esp. in engineering in nepal) has this strategy. "Don't  make noise. Or I will skip the topics from the course!"

You should really know some of many things the student is thinking at that instant.

"That teacher does not know anything and just found an excuse for not-teaching!"
"He just can't teach!"
"Hell yeah! That's better than wasting our time"


And there's  this another type of teachers,

"You don't ask anything!"

And the students are like

"Teach me something first!"

The point is: As equal are student responsible for their failure, there is an equal contribution from teachers. A teacher should always have at least a tiny bit of passion on their profession. 

Just like we student should consider ourselves bad if we do not read, a teacher should also consider themselves bad if the students they teach cannot even follow!

As a student, I feel that the teachers here are just to complete the course and not to really teach students.

Luckily I've seen classes which no one misses and classes which everyone. And if you are a teacher reading this article, and you are really frustrated teaching a bunch of use-less students always making noise. It's time to think. Are you making them better or worse?
