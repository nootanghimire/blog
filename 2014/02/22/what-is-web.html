As a mozillian, i always say my fellow people the web is everything. It's what mozilla's mission is: to promote the web,
to make web accessible and creatable via anyone. But seriously? Is web everything? For some people: it's just a small part
of the computing realm. What is web if not a mere alignment of tags and styles and "scripts"? What is web if not a tool to
waste your time watching porn and chatting with useless pervs? 

Well, like many things in this universe, the perception is what makes people differ in their thoughts.

Ask me: What is Web? My answer would still be <b><em>everything</em></b>. And I have a explaination for that!

Here's what happened to me recently. I was watching an awesome TV series on youtube,  "Da Vinci's Demons" (You might guess 
i am a fan of 'Leonardo' kind of people :P ), and suddenly my OS stopped responding. In vain, I just lowered my hand, reached 
to the big button in the CPU, and pressed the tiny button on the top of it. But as soon as i restarted my computer, i was like
"What the fuck?". My screen would show only a console with not even all of linux's commands. Frustrated, I did so many things in 
vain that i eventualy fucked my own hard-drive.

Well, Since i always keep my codes on github and documents on Google Drive.(Here's a first point for web :D ) I didn't had to worry about my data
except for my "Game of Thrones" and "Sherlock" and "Breaking Bad" collection, but since i was on the pressure of both work and college,
i would say i had no time to buy an hard disk instantly. After my continuos efforts on trying to resolve my hard disk error, i ended up 
having to use a live distribution of Ubuntu 13.10 .

Live CDs are good but in a way useless. I can't install or store anything permanently (given the fact that your hard disk is fucked, like mine).
So, what good was that computer for me?  Why should i even boot my computer with a live CD? 

I booted in anyway, and then suddenly when  `unity` popped up, my eyes went to the 4th icon on the sidebar. It was an earth and half of it's part was surrounded by a reddish fox.

Firefox. The "Web" browser.
