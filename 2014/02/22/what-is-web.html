As a mozillian, i always say my fellow people the web is everything. It's what mozilla's mission is: to promote the web,
to make web accessible and creatable via anyone. But seriously? Is web everything? For some people: it's just a small part
of the computing realm. What is web if not a mere alignment of tags and styles and "scripts"? What is web if not a tool to
waste your time watching porn and chatting with useless pervs? 
<br><br>
Well, like many things in this universe, the perception is what makes people differ in their thoughts.
<br><br>
Ask me: What is Web? My answer would still be <b><em>everything</em></b>. And I have a explaination for that!
<br><br>
Here's what happened to me recently. I was watching an awesome TV series on youtube,  "Da Vinci's Demons" (You might guess 
i am a fan of 'Leonardo' kind of people :P ), and suddenly my OS stopped responding. In vain, I just lowered my hand, reached 
to the big button in the CPU, and pressed the tiny button on the top of it. But as soon as i restarted my computer, i was like
"What the fuck?". My screen would show only a console with not even all of linux's commands. Frustrated, I did so many things in 
vain that i eventualy fucked my own hard-drive.
<br><br>
Well, Since i always keep my codes on github and documents on Google Drive.(Here's a first point for web :D ) I didn't had to worry about my data
except for my "Game of Thrones" and "Sherlock" and "Breaking Bad" collection, but since i was on the pressure of both work and college,
i would say i had no time to buy an hard disk instantly. After my continuos efforts on trying to resolve my hard disk error, i ended up 
having to use a live distribution of Ubuntu 13.10 .
<br><br>
Live CDs are good but in a way useless. I can't install or store anything permanently (given the fact that your hard disk is fucked, like mine).
So, what good was that computer for me?  Why should i even boot my computer with a live CD? 
<br><br>
I booted in anyway, and then suddenly when  `unity` popped up, my eyes went to the 4th icon on the sidebar. It was an earth and half of it's part was surrounded by a reddish fox.
<br><br>
Firefox. The "Web" browser.
<br><br>
The first thing i always do after opening browser is check emails, and facebook. I did that to know we had an computer assignment to complete,
also i had to do some writings for my work, (which i obviously wasn't going to complete on one stand). So, I was kind of frustrated. How do i accomplish these? 
Should I keep my machine ON until my work is accomplished so that i can preserve everything? 
<br><br>
Someone said it wisely, problems leads to solution.
<br><br>
Some minutes of bewilderment, and the next tab i opened was Google Drive. I created a document for my work. Wrote a bunch of characters.
Created an presentation for a college project. Closed the machine. Got back another day and resumed the work. The Web. Maybe it was the first time that web made me feel so complete
even without the presence of things that i would need for day to day computing. After i got the form, i was coding, writing slides, writing documents, fixing meetings, 
even did something more that i couldn't have done easily just withou the machine itself.
<br><br>
I even completed the whole season for "Da Vinci's Demons". I am writing this blog right now. Next to my tab is Wikipedia, Youtube, Google Drive. I even have
a tab for "Koding", which allows me to <b><em>use</em></b> a computer with all the features. 
<br><br>
I do not need any media player or codecs to play video. Firefox also works as my PDF viewer. I can even play games in a browser. 
There is so much to the wen.
<br><br>
It's been three days since i am out of my hard drive, and it seems my productivity is increased. Why? Because of the Web. The Web which we promote in mozilla.
<br><br>
I've never been a proud mozillian before. Come, join me and thousands of others in this movement to take the web even further. 
<br><br>
Just imagine, how good would it be to make the web open, and accessible to everone. Just imagine how good would it be to make the web more effective than it is currently.
Just imagine how many people can you help by promoting an open web.
<br><br>
<br>
Let's move the web forward!
